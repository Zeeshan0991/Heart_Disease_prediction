# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for feature insights
- Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation
- Performance Metrics Visualization

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
4. Modify or extend the notebook as needed to test additional models or datasets.

## Dataset
The project uses a heart disease dataset (ensure the dataset file is included or accessible). Update the file path in the notebook if necessary.

## Results
The notebook provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the trained models. It also includes visualizations to better understand the model's performance.
